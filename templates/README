Unitjs templates

This directory contains a minimal app for javascript (that would be run in a
browser) and 2 tests-* subdirectories, each showing an alternate way to test
the app.

Some notes:
- the index.html page does nothing; it is a valid xhtml template (if you're
  looking for one :) ) 
- the application.js file contains a simple module (my_module) with one very
  simple function, for demonstration purposes only
- You can view tests of this function in each of the 3 tests-* directories by
  pointing your browser to tests-*/tests.html
- The tests will run automatically.  You can build different testing behaviours
  such as running groups of tests from a button instead of running all
  automatically when the page loads.

The test directories are:
- tests-simple/
  - shows a single series of tests; no sections
- tests-sections/
  - shows how to organise tests into sections which can be
    arbitrarily nested

To use this template:
1) copy one of the tests-* directories into your own javascript app
2) rename this directory to tests/ or whatever you prefer
3) edit tests/tests.html file accordingly
   - script tags correctly reference your application code (so you can invoke
     it and test it)
   - the unitjs script and link tags correctly reference the unitjs code 
4) start writing your own tests in tests/tests.js

Notes:
- assertions are stored in the default A namespace (which you can change
  in your tests.js file - near the top). 
  For testing I tend to use only A.assert and A.assertEquals but there are
  others which are defined in the unitjs.js file in the main directory.
