1   We don't count errors and fails; and I still need to
    figure out if we are clearly distinguishing between these
    two. [DB]
2   Stack trace is a bit of a mess.  Firefox seems to have the
    best one but it is not being used here (or not a lot)
    because the code uses its own error object
    JsUnitException. [DB]
3   The way 'testOrder' and 'tests' work means that our tests are
    anonymous functions.  This may make tracing errors harder
    if they are in the tests.  Although, anonymous functions
    are handy and get used everywhere so this is just a fact
    of life. [DB]
