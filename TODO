  - expand/collapse functions to expand/collapse all sections/subsections -
    without showing the tests
  - sections with 0 tests should be highlighted in a neutral colour - blue
  - similarly, maybe we could highlight tests with 0 assertions with the same
    colour scheme
  - expand only sections which are empty or contain empty sections or empty tests
}

missing tests and stats/section runner re-implementation {
  @author: DB
  @date: 27-Jan-10
  - test stats collection for a series of tests (this might be done already)
  - test stats collection for a section of tests (excl. subsections)
  - test stats collection for a section of tests incl subsections
  - test stats merge
  - rewrite the way stats are collected for sections and their subsections
    - at the moment I think as the sections test runner recurses, the stats
      collection also recurses possibly needlessly; that is, calculateStats()
      is inefficient or being inappropriately used.
      The sections runner should probably return stats which we merge.

1   We don't count errors and fails; and I still need to
    figure out if we are clearly distinguishing between these
    two. [DB]
2   Stack trace is a bit of a mess.  Firefox seems to have the
    best one but it is not being used here (or not a lot)
    because the code uses its own error object
    JsUnitException. [DB]
3   The way 'testOrder' and 'tests' work means that our tests are
    anonymous functions.  This may make tracing errors harder
    if they are in the tests.  Although, anonymous functions
    are handy and get used everywhere so this is just a fact
    of life. [DB]
