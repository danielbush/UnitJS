DB - Daniel Bush

Latest
* An error should should say ERROR; and a fail should say FAIL [DB]
* We can now say: "Xth assertion failed" for a test [DB]
* throw an error and get its real stack trace just below the failed
  assertion for fails
* Fail and error stack traces both make use of firefox
  stack trace (if available), not the old jsunit stack trace [DB]
  * the issue is when an assertion fails, the old jsunit code
    used its own customised stack trace, which didn't work
    well with anonymous functions / modularised javascript.
* Count tests (passes, fails, errors) and total assertions [DB]
* Modularised the unitJS module into several submodules. [DB]
* Implemented namespacing/packaging standard - 
  see http://js.web17.com.au/specs/packaging-and-namespacing/index.xhtml [DB]

Version 0.1
* Project started on 28-Aug-08. [DB]
* Assertions and related support functions have been ported

* Tests of the assertion functions have also been ported
  from jsunit and work on firefox 3 and IE 6. [DB]
