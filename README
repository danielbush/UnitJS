Unitjs - a small, flexible testing framework for javascript and optionally the browser.

Why?
* You can create nested sections of tests
* Nice, "lispy" with_tests(...) function for creating sections and subsections of tests

Example:


Set up

See examples/index.html for setting up in the browser when developing unitjs.
For creating a single file, see build/*.list files. Concatenate ext files then main files.  Separately make available any files in assets.list.
